      <h1>The current problem.</h1>
      <h2>You are under attack</h2>
      <article>
          You were supposed to be collecting the meager summer harvest for this first year settleing this valley.
          But then, warning of a large scale attack arrives, and you rush to the front with your allies to reinforce your limited forces.
          You find your self facing Hobgoblins driving a force of Goblins before them. 
          You, your allies, and your meager force of elven scouts, are all that stands between 400 men women and children, and the certin, painful death at the end of that well known Hobgoblin brutality.
          While your forces are split to your east and west holding the flanks against these villans. 
          You and your 4 friends stand against, a Hobgoblin Warchief who is rushing at you, lead by 3 suicidal Goblin Bombers and their Hobgoblin Alchmeist Teacher, and 3 Goblin Lancers astride their foul dog like mounts.
          They are supported by 3 Goblin Archers directed by a Hobgoblin Seargent to the East, and 3 Goblin Spell-slingers directed by a Hobgoblin Mystic to the West.

      <h2>Outstanding Concerns</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>That angry fey demon hybrid and its improbable companions.</li>
        <li>The fey fates stringing you along</li>
        <li>The lost immortality of the Immortal King</li>
        <li>An ancient elven journal and two unknown elven crowns</li>
        <li>The wizard's tower and the ancient evil he was studying</li>
        <li>OH! How could I forget politics! In Felstad!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The local enviroment</h2>
      <p>
          In the far north of Golarion's largest continent, tucked in between the the mountians and the world wound, stands a virgin forest of darkwood. 
          The growing seasons are short, and the game is sparce. 
          Only a few structures stand in the stand in the burgoning outpost. 
          With only a few Aurochs, and just recently 2 horses the village has an urgent need for some domesticated animals. 
          Near by there was recently a world tree that was corrupt, however it was burned down, and a new onw will be planted in the coming spring. 
          There is a harsh mountian range just to the north filled with a rare mineral they are not yet equiped to extract or refine.
