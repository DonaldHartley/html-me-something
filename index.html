      <h1>The current problem.</h1>
      <h2>You are under attack</h2>
      <article>
          You were supposed to be collecting the meager summer harvest for this first year settleing this valley.
          But then warning of a large scale attack arrives, and you rush to the front with your allies to reinforce your limited forces.
          You find your self facing Hobgoblins driving a force of Goblins before them. You, your allies, and your meager force of elven scouts,
          are all that stands between 400 men women and children, and the certin, painful death at the end of that well known Hobgoblin brutality.
          While your forces are split to your east and west holding the flanks against these villans. You and your 4 friends stand against,
          a Hobgoblin Warchief is rushing at you, lead by 3 suicidal Goblin Bombers and their Hobgoblin Alchmeist Teacher, and 3 Goblin Lancers astride their foul dog like mounts.
          They are supported by 3 Goblin Archers directed by a Hobgoblin Seargent to the East, and 3 Goblin Spell-slingers directed by a Hobgoblin Mystic to the West.
